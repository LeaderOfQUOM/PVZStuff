Offset


plant:
04(04)   -		undecided ??? strange pointer
08(08)   -  x      - x offset of flower, from its position on field (note, that is doesn't change its hitbox, and effective position, it will still shoot on the same lane)
08(08)   -  y      - y offset of flower, from its position on field (note, that is doesn't change its hitbox, and effective position, it will still shoot on the same lane)
1C(28)   - 	lane				- lane on which it is planted (from 0 to 5)														| ???
24(36)   -  plantType   - type of plant
28(40)   - 	plantOffset			- offset on this lane in tiles (from 0 to 8)											| ???

54(84)   -   timer           - plant timer, that it uses for actions, like shooting            | ???
58(88)   -   timerMax        - max Value of plant timer, to which it sets, when timer reaches 0 |000
offset: 14C or divisor of 14C

FieldTileArray[laneOffset][Lane]:
size: 9 * 6, always
persists through plants choices in survival
Has initial offset of 168(360) before actual tile values
values: 1 - defaultGrass, 3 - Water
on not pool levels 6th row contains 2s
can be found by planting plant, and debugging at breakpoint on 00065161|00465161 it will be equeal to edi + 0x168

(??)mainArray:

90(144) - zombieArray
A0(160) - zombieCount - number of zombies, currently on the field
AC(172) - plantArray
B0(176) - maximal number of plants, that were on the level
B8(184) - unk - related to plants count, and sometimes equal to BC, but i don't know what it actually is
BC(188) - plantCount2 - number of plants, currently planted on level, not sure what difference between B8 and BC adresses
C8(200) - projectileArray


finally i found it! It contains many structures, like pointer to plants, and zombies array, and much more
can be found be debugging on 0041C95C, in edx
also, during start of the level it is an argument, and lying in stack in function 00407B79
will describe and write it a bit later)
00007D13|00407D13 contains pointer to array with pointer on projectiles array in its arguments and stack ()

zombieArray[zombie id]:
initiasl offset - 0,
just consecutive zombies structures,
distance between zombies: 348
