tag atomaric means, that function works, and not crashes when calling from any place of code, so it is independent and atomaric
tag jmp means, that function is acessed with, instead of regular call.

(?)  0006D890|0046D890  	-	moveCatapultProjectile	(???) 								- moves projectiles of catapult type

(!)	 0006D490|0046D490		-	movePeaProjectile		(???)								   - moves projectiles of pea type

(!)  001312D0|005312D0    - hitArmorlessZombie(DMGTrait, DMG, zombieStruct*)                       process damage to armorless zombie
all arguments via pushing to stack
DMTrait for example if set to 4, freezes zombie, 1 makes bullet act like a catapult one, and so on
atomaric

(!)  00130FE0|00530FE0    - hitArmoredZombie    (zombieStruct*, DMG)                                   process damage to armored zombie
zombieStruct* via push, DMG in eax
atomaric

(??) 001317ะก0|005317C0    - hitZombie(???)  - um... seems to hit zombie, but i am not sure, maybe it also does something else with it, cause it checks for lots of zombie states, or it is just processing zombie behaviour

(??) 00065A90|00465A90    - undecided(???)  - Somehow Processes flower behaviour, but i don't understand yet

(??) 0001C950|0041C950    - undecided(???)  - Seems to be something utilitarian, related to painting textures on screen, and it is also being used by whole 100+ different functions!

(??) 00016FAC|00416FAC    - undecided(???)  - closely related to drawing objects on screen.
eax takes in what is drawing
eax values: 2 - zombie, 5 - plant 14(20) - lawnmower,
