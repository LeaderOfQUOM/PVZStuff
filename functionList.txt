tag atomaric means, that function works, and not crashes when calling from any place of code, so it is independent and atomaric
tag jmp means, that function is acessed with, instead of regular call.

(?)  0006D890|0046D490  	-	moveCatapultProjectile	(???) 								- moves projectiles of catapult type

(!)	 0006D490|0046D890		-	movePeaProjectile		(???)								   - moves projectiles of pea type

(!)  001312D0|005312D0    - hitArmorlessZombie(DMGTrait, DMG, zombieStruct*)                       process damage to armorless zombie
all arguments via pushing to stack
DMTrait for example if set to 4, freezes zombie, 1 makes bullet act like a catapult one, and so on
atomaric

(!)  00130FE0|00530FE0    - hitArmoredZombie    (zombieStruct*, DMG)                                   process damage to armored zombie
zombieStruct* via push, DMG in eax
atomaric

(??) 001317ะก0|005317C0    - hitZombie(???)  - um... seems to hit zombie, but i am not sure, maybe it also does something else with it, cause it checks for lots of zombie states, or it is just processing zombie behaviour

(??) 00065A90|00465A90    - undecided(???)  - Somehow Processes flower behaviour, but i don't understand yet

(??) 0001C950|0041C950    - undecided(???)  - Seems to be something utilitarian, related to painting textures on screen, and it is also being used by whole 100+ different functions!

(??) 00016FAC|00416FAC    - undecided(???)  - closely related to drawing objects on screen.
(??) 0011504B|0051504B    - seems to process lots of events, like planting, spawning projectile, zombie eating a plant and etc		
(??) 0006D058|0046D058    - maybe does check of collision for projectiles
(??) 0001C950|0041C950    - calculates real adress of last plant in array, or maybe at give id, climbing up 1 plant at a time, and looking at special flag of maxPlant on plant+148(328) (this flag can also be responsible for something else
(??) 0001ะก8ะ0|0041C8A0    - calculates real address of last zombie in array, or maybe at given id, climbing up 1 zombie at a time, and looking at special flag of zombie on ??? (this flag can also be 
responsible for something else btw)
eax takes in what is drawing
eax values: 2 - zombie, 5 - plant 14(20) - lawnmower,
